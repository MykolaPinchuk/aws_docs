# aws_docs
repo with docs on how to get started with AWS

### Notes:
- I get started with AWS following SAA certification course by Cantrill.
- I create two accounts: general and production.
- For each one I create iamadmin user. I will mostly use this one.
- I secure both root and iam accounts via MFA Google auth. Thus 4 entries in the app.
- Accounts aliases fir iam roles are mp-general and mp-production
- I do not expect using AWS for my personal projects any time soon. They will stay in GCP only for the time being. Not just because of cost (free GCP vs nao free AWS), but due to higher setup/maintenance time cost of bilding in AWS. It seems that GCP is better suited for personal projects regardless of monetary cost.
