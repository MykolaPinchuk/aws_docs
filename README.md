# aws_docs
repo with docs on how to get started with AWS

### Notes:
- I get started with AWS following SAA certification course by Cantrill.
- I create two accounts: general and production.
- For each one I create iamadmin user. I will mostly use this one.
- I secure both root and iam accounts via MFA Google auth. Thus 4 entries in the app.
